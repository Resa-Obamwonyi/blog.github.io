            Happiness is created. Unlike popular belief that you find your
            Happiness in someone or something, This might not always be the
            case. Learning to create and find your own happiness irrespective of
            situations and circumstances is one of the best ways to live a
            healthier and fruitful life.

            <b>Thanksgiving. </b>Constant appreciation for the things we have
            and the things around us can help us be more content and pleased.
            Focusing on other people and what they have that we seem to lack
            might not always be the best thing to do. Be grateful for the sun,
            the sky, the flowers, the moon, food, laughter, good health,
            colours, children, family and so many other things that you have in
            your life.
          </p>
          <blockquote id="quote">
            <i>
              &quot;Be grateful for the sun, the sky, the flowers, the moon,
              food, laughter, good health, colours, children, family.&quot;
            </i>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            <b>Contentment. </b> This usually goes hand in hand with
            Thanksgiving. Being content does not mean that you do not want or
            aspire for more, It simply means that you are at peace with where
            you are, even as you aspire to be better or more. You are not
            dwelling in envy or bitterness towards your neighbour. You are not
            being covetous or comparing yourself to any other person.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Understanding That Life is Meant to be Lived. </b> Understand
            that life is not a competition for who can own the most properties.
            It is meant to be lived to the fullest in peace, satisfaction,
            appreciation and wonder. The biggest killer of your happiness is
            comparison. Comparison can lead to an unhealthy ambitious sprit
            which can cause strife, hate, displeasure and unhappiness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember, life is meant to be Enjoyed, not Endured. Find Joy and
            Happiness in the little things. Begin with a Baby's Chuckle.
